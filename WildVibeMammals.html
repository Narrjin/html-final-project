        <p>Lions can be active at any time of the day but their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of 
            socializing and grooming. Most hunting often takes place at dusk. Apart from that African lions spend much of 
            their time resting. They rest in order to save energy, in the absence of prey, or to escape the midday heat. 
            African lions are highly social animals, gathering in groups or prides, which include up to 3 male lions and multiple 
            lionesses with their young. Prides are defended by males, who patrol and mark the territory. However, there's harsh competition
            between males for the territory and position in the pride. In a case, if another male overcomes the leading male of the pride, 
            he usually kills all cubs, sired by the previous male. Meanwhile, males do not tend to hunt due to their slow speed and eye-catching 
            appearance. Instead, hunting is left to females of the pride, who hunt in groups, cooperating with each other during their hunting
            trips. The females are excellent hunters: they are faster and more agile than males, able to hunt down animals that are much bigger 
            and faster than them. Lions have a large repertoire of vocalizations. Most of them are variations of growling, snarling, meowing, 
            and roaring. Other sounds produced include purring, puffing, bleating, and humming. Roaring is used for advertising their presence.
            Lions most often roar at night, a sound that can be heard from a distance of 8 km (5 mi).</p>

        <p>Tigers are solitary animals, except during the mating season and when the females give birth. They like to be mostly alone, 
            roaming their huge territories in search of food. They mark their territories with secretions and scratch marks on trees.
            Resident adults of either sex generally confine their movements to their home ranges, within which they satisfy their needs 
            and those of their growing cubs. Individuals sharing the same area are aware of each other's movements and activities.
            Territory disputes are usually solved by intimidation rather than outright violence. Once dominance has been established, 
            a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, as long as they do not live in too close quarters. Tigers are most active 
            during the night when their prey is most active. They can, however, be active at any time. They prefer to hunt within dense 
            vegetation, using routes where they are able to move quietly. They knock prey onto the ground with the weight of their body
            and kill their catch by biting their neck. They are very good swimmers and often bathe in ponds, lakes, and rivers, thus 
            keeping cool in the heat of the day; they can even kill prey while swimming. Tigers communicate through facial expressions 
            and vocally. The most common facial expression includes the "defense threat", where an individual bares its teeth, and
            flattens its ears and its pupils enlarge. Like other members of their family, tigers roar, particularly in aggressive 
            situations, during the mating season, or when making a kill. They will also chuff which is a soft, low-frequency snorting 
            similar to purring in smaller cats. Other vocal communications include grunts, woofs, snarls, miaows, hisses, and growls.</p>

        <p>They are diurnal, spending 40% of the day resting, 30% traveling, and another 30% - feeding. They rest and sleep in nests, 
            placed on steep slopes, in trees, or on the ground. Eastern gorillas gather in social units called harems, which contain
            a male and females with their young. Gorilla harems are not territorial, though conflicts and encounters can happen,
            particularly when a lone male gets into contact with members of the harem. Grooming is a common activity for these gorillas,
            usually occurring between males and females as well as among females. These animals are very calm and care for their babies,
            forming strong bonds within the group. Eastern gorillas use a wide variety of communication forms, interacting with each
            other or warning intruders to keep away.</p>
